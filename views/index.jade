		h3 Creative technologist

		p|I work with <a href="http://artech.cc/" target="_blank">Theo Papatheodorou</a> as a creative technologist. Our studio is called <a href="http://randomquark.com" target="_blank">random quark</a> and you can see the <a href="http://randomquark.com/#work" target="_blank">work we've done together</a> on that site. We build large scale projections with projection mapping and generative art algorithms. We also create interactive installations with a variety of technologies including openFrameworks, C++, openCV, physical computing, Kinect and more.

		h3 Full stack web developer

		p|I also do <b>freelance and contract web development</b>, specialising in front end development, node.js on the backend and microservices. I’m happy to work in plenty of other languages, the more esoteric the better. You might want to take a look at my <a href="/portfolio">web portfolio</a> or my <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/tom-chambers-6b5199a4">LinkedIn profile</a>.

		h3 Artist

		p.
			As an artist I’m interested in questioning the way we do things. Our work lives, the way we interact and the structures that guide our thought. I like creating immersive experiences that compel people to consider these questions in an intuitive way.

				"Tom joined the second Entrepreneur First cohort - a highly selective investment programme for the most talented and innovative graduates. He impressed us from the beginning for his imaginative approach, his drive and his commitment to solving real-world problems. He demonstrated an ability to work hard, deliver products under pressure and respond effectively to feedback. It was great working with Tom and we'd always be delighted to do so again."
